- Data Integration & Automation: Automated key data workflows with tools like Docker and Kubernetes, ensuring efficient and reliable data movement across various platforms. I utilized AWS services like S3 for storage and Lambda for event-driven processing, enhancing the scalability and speed of data operations.
- Database Management: Optimized the performance of MySQL databases by restructuring tables, indexing, and tuning queries to ensure efficient storage and retrieval of data. This reduced query response time significantly and improved system performance.
- Data Governance & Validation: Ensured data quality and compliance through rigorous validation processes and monitoring tools. Developed custom scripts in Python to clean and transform data, ensuring accuracy and consistency across all datasets.
- Collaboration & Reporting: Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including data analysts and product managers, to understand data requirements and deliver tailored solutions. Created automated reports and dashboards that provided actionable insights to stakeholders.

## Data Projects

1. **Mental Health & Music Analysis Project**
- This project aimed to examine the relationship between music and mental health across different demographics, with the goal of identifying how music influences emotional well-being. By analyzing data, I sought to uncover trends and correlations that could inform research or therapeutic approaches to mental health.

- Tech Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy) for data analysis, AWS Glue for efficient data cleaning and transformation, Python for visualizations that made the insights easy to interpret.

- Techniques Used: I utilized AWS Glue for data preprocessing and handling, ensuring the dataset was clean and well-structured for analysis. Correlation analysis was employed to identify potential links between specific genres of music and mental health outcomes. I also applied demographic segmentation to understand how music preferences impacted different groups based on age, gender, and other factors. Python was instrumental in data manipulation and visualizations that highlighted key findings and trends.

- Desired Outcome: The goal was to reveal *How different types of music influence mental health across various demographic groups*, providing insights that could be used in future mental health research or in developing therapeutic tools. The project aimed to showcase the potential for personalized music therapy and contribute to a deeper understanding of music’s role in mental wellness.

2. **Movie Recommendation Engine Application**
- I built and deployed a movie recommendation engine on localhost using **Flask**, allowing users to get **personalized movie suggestions based on their preferences**. The system leverages the *TMDB dataset of 9000 movies* and offers multiple recommendation methods to enhance the user experience.

- Key Features:
Users can select a movies and receive 10 personalized recommendations.
Movie recommendations based on title search, genre, or language filters.
Display of ratings for all recommended movies.
Halloween-themed interface for an engaging user experience.
- Tech Stack:
*Flask for backend routing.
Pandas & NumPy for data preprocessing.
HTML, CSS for the front-end, 
TMDB Dataset for movie metadata.*
- Techniques:
*Content-Based Filtering for personalized recommendations, 
Data Preprocessing to ensure clean and accurate data.*
- Outcome:
The engine provides flexible, user-friendly movie recommendations with multiple input methods, offering a smooth and enjoyable movie discovery experience.
